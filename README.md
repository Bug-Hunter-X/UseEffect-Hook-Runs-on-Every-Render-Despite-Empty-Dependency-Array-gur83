# React useEffect Hook Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an issue where a React `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array still runs on every render.  This is unexpected and can lead to performance issues.

## Problem

The provided `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (`[]`).  This is intended to make the effect run only once after the initial render. However, in some scenarios (possibly due to optimizations or edge cases), this effect might fire more often. 

## Solution

The solution lies in carefully examining the component's logic and identifying any factors causing unintended re-renders.  Sometimes, optimizing the component itself or using techniques like `useCallback` and `useMemo` may resolve the issue.
